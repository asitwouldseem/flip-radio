## Real Time Clock
I use a Jaycar-special DS3231 RTC module. There wasn't much documentation out there, but it connects to pins 1,3,5,7 and 9. A real-time clock is possibly overkill given internet-connected and a flip clock. But let's do it anyway.

Open the /boot/config file. I like nano so let's use that. Substitute for your text editor of choice.
```sudo nano /boot/config.txt```

Add the following line below the i2c_arm line we added when installing the DAC.
```dtoverlay=i2c-rtc,ds3231```

Check whether the DS3231 is detected. You should get a 'UU' in row 60, column 8.
```sudo i2cdetect -y 1```

At this point, we now need to instruct the Pi to use the DS3231 as our main clock. Open the hwclock-set file:
```sudo nano /lib/udev/hwclock-set```

Change the file to this: 
```
#if [ -e /run/systemd/system ] ; then
#    exit 0
#fi

#/sbin/hwclock --rtc=$dev --systz
#/sbin/hwclock --rtc=$dev --hctosys
```
